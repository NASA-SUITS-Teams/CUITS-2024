# 🦁 Welcome to Team CUITS' Repo for the NASA SUITS Challenge (2023-2024)! 🚀💻

## Introduction
Roarrr! Welcome to the den of Team CUITS, where we are tackling the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge for the stellar year 2023-2024! We're thrilled to have you join the cosmic mission.

## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain the harmony of our digital spacewalk, here are the rules for contributing to the NASA SUITS repository:

### 1. Branching Strategy
- 🌲 Make sure you have your own branch for your contributions. Branch names should be descriptive and prefixed with your initials or a relevant identifier.
  Example: `feature/TS-001-add-authentication`

- 📬 If you don't have your own branch yet, reach out to our wise leaders, Moises or Jonah, to claim your territory in the codebase.

### 2. Unity Etiquette
- 🚀 ALWAYS close Unity before committing and pushing to your branch. Let's keep our space station tidy and prevent intergalactic code collisions.

### 3. Merging to Main
- 🚀 Merges to the main branch will be orchestrated during our group meetings. Keep your work on your own branch until the group, with its collective cosmic wisdom, agrees to initiate a merge.

## Getting Started
Embark on your coding expedition by checking out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more detailed instructions on how to contribute.

## Code of Conduct
Let's explore the codebase with mutual respect and inclusivity. Check our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for guidelines.

## License

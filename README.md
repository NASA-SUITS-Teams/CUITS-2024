# 🦁 Welcome to Team CUITS' SUITS Repo (2023-2024)! 🚀💻

## Introduction
Roarrr! Welcome to the den of Team CUITS' SUITS (Software, Updates, Integrations, and Technical Solutions) for the stellar year 2023-2024! We're thrilled to have you join the pride.

## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain the harmony of our digital savannah, here are the rules for contributing to the SUITS repository:

### 1. Branching Strategy
- 🌲 Make sure you have your own branch for your contributions. Branch names should be descriptive and prefixed with your initials or a relevant identifier.
  Example: `feature/TS-001-add-authentication`

- 📬 If you don't have your own branch yet, reach out to our wise leaders, Moises or Jonah, to claim your territory in the codebase.

### 2. Unity Etiquette
- 🚀 ALWAYS close Unity before committing and pushing to your branch. Let's keep our launchpad tidy and prevent intergalactic code collisions.

### 3. Merging to Main
- 🚀 Merges to the main branch will be orchestrated during our group meetings. Keep your work on your own branch until the group, with its collective cosmic wisdom, agrees to initiate a merge.

## Getting Started

# ü¶Å Welcome to Team CUITS Repo for the NASA SUITS Challenge (2023-2024)! üöÄüíª

## Introduction
### The following are features found within the unity project in the repo
1. Persistent Brain (Main Manager): ‚ÄúTheBrain‚Äù takes the lead, managing scene switches, hand-tracked menus, and data persistence. It stays with you throughout your holographic journey. 
2. CUITS Menu: A hand-tracked menu emerges when your palm faces up. Work-in-progress, but the scenes button lets you dive into the program‚Äôs universe. Back buttons ensure smooth navigation. 
3. Map: Experience a static image of the Houston rockyard. The map object unfolds on pressing the map button, resizable and soon lockable to your gaze. 
4. TSS Scene: The TSS scene transforms with MRTK prefabs. Seamless connection with buttons and input fields for a straightforward experience. 
5. UIA: Included a UIA scene --- the very start of how we tackle UIA procedures. We plan to have a slate that the user can place next the the real UIA interface. Our slate will then light up to show when the corresponding switch needs to be flipped. 
6. Serialized Json: We include a new script, Serialized_TSS, which builds off of the script provided by the tech team. We will use the base found in this script to
Isolate specific values through a dictionary type structure.

*We also include a very base implementation of an LMCC*
